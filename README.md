# First-Ladder

## First Ladder Parodox
`First Ladder Parodox`: It can be hard to download censorship circumvention tools (a.k.a ladders) without already having and using one of them. This is because almost all the website of censorship circumvention tools are censored by censors. In addition, although most of the censorship cicumvention tools developers do provide an unblockable way for download their tools, those unblockable webpages suffer from the following problems:

- Those downloading webpages are usually not shown by the search engine that collaborate with oppresive regimes.
- Those downloading webpages usually have a relatively long or random URL which is really hard to remember.
- Downloading webpages are scattered in different corner of the Internet, causing people hard to find them all.

## The First-Ladder Project

First-Ladder provides a nevigation page for downloading censorship circumvention tools in an unblockable way. First Ladder excersices Collateral Freedom strategy which means the project can be hosted on whatever webservics sthat are too expensive to be blocked by the censors (right now, it is hosted on Github).

## Trust models

There are two different trust models in First-Ladder, depending on the `Provider` of the downloading webpage. To be more specific, if the `Provider` is marked as `Official`, it means the official developers are the ones provides the unblockable download and First-Ladder cannot and touch the binary you download. If the `Provider` is marked as `First-Ladder`, it means the ladder is distributed by First-Ladder so First-Ladder does touch the binary.

For the case where `Official` is the provider, since First-Ladder cannot touch the binary you download, there is **not need to trust** the First-Ladder project. For `First-Ladder` as the distributor, `First-Ladder` has the ability to add malfunction to the ladder. To solve this trusting problem, `First-Ladder` does not beg for users' trust, instead, `First-Ladder` provides user with reliable way to do verification themselves. And one person's found of `First-Ladder`'s mal-behavious means the death to the entire project.
